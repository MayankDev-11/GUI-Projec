# Color Theme Maker

This is one of the really cool GUI's i have made using tkinter.
    
Features of this Project:
  - This allows you to choose your desired color
  - This gives you the hex and rgb format of the color
  - This saves the colors which you like with rgb and hex values
  - It has buttons of the primary colors like:
      - Red
      - Green
      - Blue
      - Yellow
      - Cyan
      - Magenta
  - It has a feature to store of your desired colors on screen and recall them as you want.

I hope you like this!!
